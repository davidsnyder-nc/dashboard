## ‚ú® Key Features

This dashboard is more than just a list of folders. It's a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline your local development workflow.

### üóÇÔ∏è Dynamic Project Cards
- **Automatic Discovery:** Automatically detects and displays all project folders in your web root.
- **Custom Logos:** Displays a project-specific logo (`logo.png`) if available, otherwise creates a stylish placeholder.
- **GitHub Integration:** Fetches and displays repository descriptions and topics (tags) directly on the project card.
- **Flexible Links:** Provides buttons to visit the local site, an external live URL, and the GitHub repository.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Code Assistant (Powered by Gemini)
- **Codebase Chat:** Open a chat interface to ask questions about a specific project's codebase. The AI has context of the project's file structure and the content of key files.
- **Code Analysis & Refactoring:** Select any file within a project and click "Analyze & Refactor File." The AI will perform a code review, suggest improvements, and provide a refactored version of the code alongside a clear explanation of the changes.

### üñ•Ô∏è System Monitoring with Glances
- **On-Page Stats:** An optional, clean display of real-time server stats (CPU, Memory, Disk Usage) at the top of the dashboard.
- **Full Glances Modal:** If you run a full Glances instance, you can add its URL in the settings to open the complete Glances web UI in a convenient pop-up modal directly from the dashboard header.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Comprehensive Settings Panel
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Easily reorder your projects by dragging and dropping them in the settings panel.
- **Hide Projects:** Declutter your view by hiding specific projects from the main grid.
- **Custom Metadata:** Set custom display names, descriptions, logos, and links for each project.
- **API Key Management:** Securely store your Gemini and GitHub API keys.

### üóÑÔ∏è Backups
- **Local Project Backup:** Create and download a `.zip` archive of all your project folders with a single click.
- **GitHub Repositories Backup:** Back up all of your personal GitHub repositories into a single `.zip` file (requires a GitHub Personal Access Token).

## üöÄ Setup and Requirements

The dashboard is designed to be simple to set up. It consists of a main `index.html` file and two server-side PHP scripts.

### File Structure
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html            # The main dashboard file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ browser.php           # REQUIRED: Handles server-side logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ glances.php           # OPTIONAL: For on-page system stats
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json         # Automatically created to store your settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-project-1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your-project-2/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### `browser.php` (Required)
This is the core server-side engine of the dashboard. It is **required** for the dashboard to function. Its responsibilities include:
- Listing project folders and files.
- Reading file contents for the AI assistant.
- Saving your settings to `settings.json`.
- Creating local project backups.

**You must have this file in the same directory as `index.html`.**

### `glances.php` (Optional)
This script acts as a simple proxy to a running [Glances](https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/) instance on your server. It is **only required if you want to see the on-page system statistics** (CPU, Memory, Disk).

To use it:
1.  Ensure you have Glances installed and running in web server mode (`glances -w`).
2.  Place the `glances.php` file in the same directory as `index.html`.
3.  Enable the "On-Page System Monitor" in the dashboard's settings.

If you do not need the on-page stats, you do not need this file. You can still use the "External Glances URL" feature to link to your Glances instance.

## üîß Configuration

All configuration is handled through the user-friendly settings panel. Click the **gear icon** in the header to get started.

1.  **General Settings:**
    - **Glances:** Enable or disable the on-page monitor and provide the URL for your external Glances instance.
    - **Gemini API Key:** Required for all AI features ("Ask Codebase", "Analyze & Refactor"). Your key is saved to `settings.json` on the server and also stored in your browser's local storage.
    - **GitHub Token:** A GitHub Personal Access Token is required for fetching repository details (to avoid rate limits) and for the GitHub repositories backup feature.

2.  **Website Settings:**
    - Drag and drop projects to set your preferred order.
    - Use the input fields for each project to customize its name, logo, description, and links.
    - Check the "Hide this folder" box to remove a project from the dashboard view without deleting it.

3.  **Backup Settings:**
    - No configuration is needed here, but the GitHub backup feature requires the GitHub Token to be set in the General tab.

Click **"Save and Close"** to apply your changes. Your configuration will be saved in a `settings.json` file in the root directory.
